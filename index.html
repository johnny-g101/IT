<h2><b>Introduction and About Me</b></h2>

<br>

<img src="selfie.jpg" alt="Photo of my Face" width="350" height="323.56322" class="center">

<br>

<p>Hi reader. My name is John Gionis. I am 20 Years of age. My nationality is half Greek-Australian. I speak a little bit of Greek but I am not fluent. I graduated High School in 2020 and am currently in the second semester of my second year studying my Batchelor of Mechanical Engineering.</p>

<p>I came to RMIT to study because the engineering program is highly commended. RMIT teaches by hands on learning, which i find very beneficial. It also happened that my school friends also are attending RMIT, which makes it more comfortable to study as there are people I can talk to.</p>

<p>Alongside the concepts and information I require to be a mechanical engineer, I would expect to mainly develop problem solving skills. This would allow me to attempt IT and Engineering as with both professions, it is expected that you utilise known concepts to scope, design and build something to solve a client's problem statement.</p>

<p>My studies relate to my insane obsession with most wheeled transportation. This mostly incorporates cars, but I also do have an interest in motorbikes, trains, and trams. The latter two have developed more since living in Melbourne.</p>

<p>An interesting fact is that my name is part of a Greek tradition that continues through my name. This tradition is that when a child is born, it is named after the son’s grandfather, and then when that child has a kid, he names it after that kid’s grandfather, and it alternates throughout generations. My grandfather is called John (Yannis).</p>

<h2><b>Interests and Experience in IT</b></h2>

<p>My interest in IT involves utilising modern computers and coding to efficiently operate mechanical systems such as a robot or a train. An example of this is the use of new and advanced aftermarket engine ECUs on 30-50 year old internal combustion engines for more efficiency than before. I also have an interest in Computer Aided Design (CAD) as I use CAD software very often within my course. I enjoy designing, drawing and rendering components that is needed for my course.</p>

<p>Initially, when doing CAD for the first time in 2018, I hated it. However, my interest and enjoyment of utilising CAD started last year during my Creative CAD unit in Semester 1. I found using Solidworks to be incredibly enjoyable to form parts, assemblies and drawings.</p>

<p>My interest in computer and electrical operated mechanical systems started much earlier than that. I could remember when I was much younger, I loved pulling apart computers, CD players and radios to see how they would work by incorporating mechanical and electrical components to form the system. I got older, I would research what each component would do and the microprocessor inputs and outputs and what they would be responsible for within the system of whatever I had pulled apart.</p>

<p>I do not have an avid fascination in networking, gaming or how the internet works. Therefore, meaning I have minimal experience with proper IT work. I have pulled apart and rebuilt computers alongside the compulsory coding I have completed in my other subjects for engineering. For example, I wrote a program in g code to create a baseplate in a C&C machine.</p>

<p>My ideal job is described that CSIRO Business and Infrastructure Services is seeking a Mechanical Systems Engineer for the technical support group based at the Australian Centre for Disease Protection (ACDP). The ACDP helps protect Australia’s multi-billion-dollar livestock and aquaculture industries, alongside protecting the general public from emerging infectious disease threats.</p>

<p>It is described that this role is to provide professional engineering and technical support services to support the B&IS (Business and Industry Services) team to help in safe and successful operation of the ACDP facility. These support services entail leading and communicating responsive, considered, and cost-effective solutions that helps management, maintenance, and operational activities in this facility. The position will ensure the Integrity of ACDP’s High Containment Laboratory.</p>

<p>This position is appealing for the following reasons:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
<li><b>Location:</b> My hometown of Geelong. This means that my support network and family/friends are close to my place of work. It also means that I do not need to readjust to a new town/city as I know where CSIRO is located</li>
<li><b>Uniqueness of the job opportunity provided:</b> Jobs for CSIRO, a government funded laboratory, would be assumed to not appear often so this would be a unique opportunity to take</li>
<li><b>Good reviews for work satisfaction:</b> 4.1 star rating out of 5</li>
<li><b>Type of work:</b> Designing and maintaining mechanical systems is very interesting to me alongside working out improvements.</li>
<li><b>Salary:</b> it is absolute least 6 figures, meaning that money would not be an issue</li>
</ul>

<p>To be eligible for this job, I need a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, aswell as at least 5 years of experience working as a mechanical engineer in an industrial, process industry, building services, or manufacturing plant environment. I also need to demonstrate commitment to HS&E, safe working practices so that I am not a liability. I would also need to provide evidence that I am able to deliver projects and/or contracts successfully within the allocated timeframe and budget and be eligible to obtain and show responsibility when holding an Australian Government security clearance at the Negative Vetting 1 level.</p>

<p>Currently at this point of time, I have minimal qualifications. As stated, I am still studying to complete my Batchelor of Mechanical Engineering. I have completed a Certificate 2 in Engineering studies at TAFE when I was in high school. As a result of my lack of qualification, I would have to complete my batchelor of mechanical engineering and work as an engineer in a setting listed above for a minimum of 5 years to even be considered. I would then apply for the job and check my eligibility for the security clearance required.</p>

<h2><b>Results of Self-Tests</b></h2>

<h3><b>Myers-Briggs personality test</b></h3>
<p>The Myers-Briggs test determined that my personality was a defender. The defender personality is described as someone who is hard working, loyal and would gladly ‘drop everything and lend a hand whenever a friend or family member is going through a hard time’ without wanting much recognition <a href="#1">[1]</a>.</p>

<h3><b>Online Learning Style test</b></h3>
<p>From the learning style test, it was determined that I am a tactile learner. This means that I am a “hands on” learner that remembers content the best when learnt by attempting tasks ‘through physical movement’<a href="#2">[2]</a>.</p>

<h3><b>Online Creativity test</b> <a href="#3">[3]</a></h3>

<br>

<img src="Screenshot 2022-08-08 160340.png" alt="Results of my Creativity test" width="700" height="500" class="center">

<br>

<p>Referring to the above diagram, it is shown that my creativity score was 57.31, which is 5.52% below average. The results also show that I have above average ‘paradox’, meaning that I have a strong ability to both ‘accept and work with statements that are contradictory’ {reference}. These results also show that I have strong ‘perspective’; ability to shift someone’s perspective on a situation, and ‘curiosity’; ability to think of ideas to solve an outlined problem {Reference}. It can also be seen that I have a lack of creative ‘persistence’; thought for stronger ideas when strong ones have been thought out, alongside a lack of creative ‘boldness’; pushing ‘boundaries beyond acepted conventions’ without ‘fear of what others think of you’.</p>

<h3><b>What do the results of these tests mean for me?</b></h3>
<p>The results of these tests determine that I am a hard-working individual, who finds joy to lend a hand to those around me who are struggling. I teach and explain things by showing examples and physically showing how the task is done. I also learn new information by physical movement (e.g. copying notes down multiple times to get concepts stuck in my head). I posess a strong ability to understand, accept and work with ideas I would not agree with, alongside coming up with initial ideas and expressing my point of view to others in the group.</p>

<h3><b>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</b></h3>
<p>This personality type will ensure that I will always be loyal and responsible when in a team. I would also be the most likely to help other people when they do need it as I feel obliged to. I would also most suit jobs/tasks within the team when forming ideas, designing, and building due to my hands on nature and creative abilities. This may cause some downfalls within my behaviour in a team as my hands on nature makes it hard for me to explain ideas when not in person. I
also would find it very hard to understand what my teammates would be saying as I would need to have it explained in an example. My helpful and outgoing nature might also provide teammates opportunities to ‘use’ me to do the work they don’t want to do. A more minor issue is my physical nature to perform tasks makes it difficult for me to sit down and do writing.</p>

<h3><b>What and how do I need to consider when forming a team?</b></h3>
<p>I would need to be considerate that not everyone is the same as me. This would have to be particularly evident when I would try to convey my ideas to my teammates and assuming that they understand. So, when forming a team, all teammates should express strengths and weaknesses with work tasks. Then, this can help decide which team member is allocated specific tasks required for group work. This should mean that the group should be as cooperative as possible as this should allow for each team member to work in the most suitable task for maximum efficiency of work.</p>

<h2><b>Project Idea</b></h2>
<h3><b>Overview:</b></h3>
<p>My proposed idea is to implement a chip that would be plugged in to an EV and ‘tune’ them from a user interface on a mobile deice such as a phone. This would mean that, in essence, the user can tweak and customise their EV from their phone. The chip would allow for unwanted features to be deactivated that usually would not be allowed to along with performance enhancements and the way the car drives can be changed at the touch of a button.</p>

<h3><b>Motivation:</b></h3>
<p>Personally, I have a lot of gripes with modern vehicles. The biggest one is all the electronic gismos and gadgets which I find incredibly annoying and distracting. I want feedback to DRIVE the car, not some computer to get it over and done with like a ‘chore’<a href="#4">[4]</a>. I would love an EV as a daily driver, but I don’t want the blandness that I would feel driving them. For example, one of my biggest criticisms that applies to most modern cars is the lack of steering feedback through the steering wheel because of the steering system that is utilised. This disconnected feel provides a lack of understanding as to what the car is doing through bends. Because the manufacturers of modern cars, EVs included, use this steering system as it is easier to drive, this reinforces a view that manufacturers OEM settings are to get driving ‘over and done with’<a href="#4">[4]</a>. My motivations is to improve the EV by providing a way for the spirited driver to tune their EV the way that they would like it. Thus, this may help the implementation of electric cars in Australia.</p>

<h3><b>Description and Projection of idea:</b></h3>
<p>The disabling of unwanted safety and enhancement features can be done by the user through their smart device. Some of my personal top picks include:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
<li>Lane Keep Assist</li>
<li>Radar Cruise control</li>
<li>Autopilot</li>
<li>Stability Control</li>
<li>Traction control</li>
<li>Blind Spot Monitoring</li>
<li>Speed Warnings</li>
<li>collision warning systems</li>
</ul>

<p>It is thought that the user will select corresponding buttons on their smart device which represents each of these systems. When a button is pressed, this message is communicated to the hardware plugged into the EV. This hardware will modify or disable the code within the EVs onboard Computers to stop these features from operating.</p>
<p>It is also thought that the information screen on the dashboard (like in Tesla’s) could be reduced to absolute fundamental operations that the user wants. This may be able to be chosen in the app by the user. For example, if the user wants only Bluetooth connectivity for music and phone calls, and climate controls, this can be selected in some sort of click box fashion. Then the desired features would be the only thing that can be operated on the screen. There may even be a feature for the user to turn the screen off altogether if they so desire.</p>
<p>To enhance the users’ driving pleasure, the user will be able to activate performance/driver-feedback to enhance the driving experience of their EV. Instead of hydraulic power steering systems of old, modern cars, including EVs, mostly utilises the Electric Power Steering System (EPAS), which utilises a computer, an electric motor and torque sensors to apply assistance power to the steering column via a ball screw mechanism, which allows the motor to apply torque to the steering column whilst also allowing for slipping. This means that the motor will passively assist the steering column in the direction that the torque sensors detect the steering wheel to be spinning instead of directly spinning the column on its own. <a href="#5">[5]</a> <a href="#6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Whilst EPAS systems require ‘less muscle’ to operate, this results in a ‘reduced steering feel’ through the steering wheel as this system has a ‘muted’ ‘mechanical connection’ compared to a hydraulic steering system <a href="#5">[5]</a>. The application should allow the user to control how much EPAS assistance that they want, with the option to turn it off altogether. The application will contain a slider, which will communicate to the hardware connected to the EV the amount of steering assistance that is to be provided by the motor. This should result in an enhanced mechanical feel provided by the steering system when taking a corner.</p>
<p>The user may also be able to enhance and change power output and curves provided by the electric motors. It is known that electric cars provide instant torque. This means that the maximum power of electric motors is gradually eased in when full throttle is applied to preserve mechanical and electrical components. However, the user may be able to select a function under a “performance options” menu, which allows instant full power as soon as full throttle is applied. This would provide enhanced throttle response, allowing for more driving pleasure.</p>
<p>Tuning and turning up power in an electric car could be paralleled with turning up the boost in a turbocharged Internal combustion engine powered car. However, instead of air pressure, it would be more like overclocking a computer; providing more power. The user would have the option to increase the charge taken (amp-hours) from the batteries by the motor controller to provide an increased charge to the motor. This would provide increased enjoyment and fun for the user. </p>

<h3><b>Tools, Technologies and Skills Required:</b></h3>
<p>First, the hardware will need to be designed by a skilled person who knows how to design electronic components so that it can be manufactured and coded to connect to EVs. This manufacturing process after final design is produced requires breadboard manufacturing, chip manufacturing and other electronic component manufacturing. It would then be required that the hardware is soldered together and code uploaded (which is a problem in itself).</p>
<p>Another technology problem to solve would be getting the device to read and modify the data for the many different makes of EVs. This is already a problem with Internal Combustion Engined vehicles as the ECUs and other modules are vehicular, let alone manufacturer specific. A majority of modern EVs utilise more complex computer systems, which may result in more variability between vehicles and manufacturers. It is thought that if one EV could be cracked and controlled, we might require the long and tedious process of getting EVs and writing alternative software to crack and operate that specific EV. If this option works, the mobile device might prompt this hardware to download these different files upon setup.</p>
<p>Another issue surrounding the operation of this product with EVs is potential software locks implemented by the manufacturer to prevent tampering. Manufacturers would be particularly motivated to prevent tweaks due to warranty, safety and maybe even paywall reasons. For example, Tesla did this to stop people bypassing paywalls and accessing certain reserved hardware for paying customers without paying <a href="#7">[7]</a>. This would require people that are good at finding exploits and loopholes in software to get around the EV manufacturers. It could be entirely possible that some makes, and models might not be able to be bypassed.</p>
<p>If this were to be commercially available, the liability of users either mechanically ruining their EVs through improper tuning or crashing them because of disabling safety features may become a problem. Particularly, crashing or battery fires because of overstress, potentially resulting in a serious injury or worse. A lawyer would be required to write a waiver when purchasing the product so that we are not responsible for anything. This is a better option then locking features as I am just as bad as the automakers then. </p>
<p>It also needs to be considered how the mobile device is going to wirelessly connect to the hardware. Bluetooth is too vulnerable for a system this important to someone’s vehicle. It might be required to use a local wi-fi network provided by the hardware which the device connects to, like a wireless printer. This then inconveniences the user because they no longer have internet to listen to music or use maps to direct where they are going</p>

<h3><b>Supposed outcomes:</b></h3>
<p>The main outcome of this product being successful is to improve current EVs for driving purists and revheads. The ability to tune and modify most types of EVs could increase electric cars’ popularity within car enthusiasts as the instant torque, and acceleration that comes along with it would be more enjoyable if the EV were to provide more feedback. </p>
<p>If the popularisation of EVs commences, this may push the government to provide a sustainably powered charging grid, reducing our carbon emission output. This popularity would also open opportunities for many tuning shops to specialise in EVs alongside Internal Combustion engine cars. This would provide jobs where revheads could be employed to do what they are passionate about.</p>
