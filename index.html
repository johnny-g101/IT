<h1><b>Assignment 1: My Profile</b></h1>
<h2><b>Introduction and About Me</b></h2>
<p>Hi reader. My name is John Gionis.<br>I am 20 Years of age, my RMIT student number is S3901535 and my<br>RMIT student email address is s3901535@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

<p>I am Australian in nationality (as I was born in Australia). However,<br>I have a strong Greek heritage on my father’s side which I can<br>engage in quite often. I was originally born in Bendigo but moved<br>to my hometown of Geelong not long before I started primary school.<br>I graduated High School in 2020 and am currently in the second<br>semester of my second year studying my Batchelor of Mechanical Engineering.</p>

<p>I came to RMIT to study because the engineering program is highlhy commended.<br>RMIT teaches by hands on learning, which i find very beneficial.<br>It also happened that my school friends also are attending RMIT,<br>which makes it more comfortable to study as there are people I can talk to.</p>

<p>Alongside the concepts and information I require to be a mechanical engineer,<br>I would expect to mainly develop problem solving skills.<br>This would allow me to attempt IT and Engineering as with both professions,<br>it is expected that you utilise known concepts to scope, design<br>and build something to solve a client's problem statement.</p>

<p>My studies relate to my insane obsession with most wheeled transportation.<br>This mostly incorporates cars, but I also do have an interest in motorbikes, trains,<br>and trams. The latter two have developed more since living in Melbourne.</p>

<p>An interesting fact is that my name is part of a Greek tradition that continues<br>through my name. This tradition is that when a child is born, it is named after the son’s<br>grandfather, and then when that child has a kid, he names it after that kid’s grandfather,<br>and it alternates throughout generations. My grandfather is called John (Yannis).</p>

<h2><b>Interests and Experience in IT</b></h2>

<p>My interest in IT involves utilising modern computers and coding<br>to efficiently operate mechanical systems such as a robot or a train.<br>An example of this is the use of new and advanced aftermarket engine<br>ECUs on 30-50 year old internal combustion engines for more efficiency<br>than before. I also have an interest in Computer Aided Design (CAD)<br>as I use CAD software very often within my course. I enjoy designing,<br>drawing and rendering components that is needed for my course {warman robot files}.</p>

<p>Initially, when doing CAD for the first time in 2018, I hated it.<br>However, my interest and enjoyment of utilising CAD started last year<br>during my Creative CAD unit in Semester 1. I found using Solidworks<br>to be incredibly enjoyable to form parts, assemblies and drawings.</p>

<p>My interest in computer and electrical operated mechanical systems<br>started much earlier than that. I could remember when I was much younger,<br>I loved pulling apart computers, CD players and radios to see how<br>they would work by incorporating mechanical and electrical components<br>to form the system. I got older, I would research what each component<br>would do and the microprocessor inputs and outputs and what they would<br>be responsible for within the system of whatever I had pulled apart.</p>

<p>I do not have an avid fascination in networking, gaming or how the<br>internet works. Therefore, meaning I have minimal experience with<br>proper IT work. I have pulled apart and rebuilt computers alongside<br>the compulsory coding I have completed in my other subjects for<br>engineering. For example, I wrote a program in g code to create<br>a baseplate in a C&C machine.</p>

<h2><b>Ideal Job Listing</b></h2>

<p>{link and photos go here}</p>

<p>My ideal job is described that CSIRO Business and Infrastructure<br>Services is seeking a Mechanical Systems Engineer for the technical<br>support group based at the Australian Centre for Disease Protection<br>(ACDP). The ACDP helps protect Australia’s multi-billion-dollar<br>livestock and aquaculture industries, alongside protecting the<br>general public from emerging infectious disease threats.</p>

<p>It is described that this role is to provide professional engineering<br>and technical support services to support the B&IS (Business and<br>Industry Services) team to help in safe and successful operation<br>of the ACDP facility. These support services entail leading and<br>communicating responsive, considered, and cost-effective solutions<br>that helps management, maintenance, and operational activities<br>in this facility. The position will ensure the Integrity of ACDP’s<br>High Containment Laboratory.</p>

<p>This position is appealing for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Location:</b> My hometown of Geelong. This means that my support network<br>and family/friends are close to my place of work. It also means<br>that I do not need to readjust to a new town/city as I know where<br>CSIRO is located</li>
<li><b>Uniqueness of the job opportunity provided:</b> Jobs for CSIRO, a<br>government funded laboratory, would be assumed to not appear often<br>so this would be a unique opportunity to take</li>
<li><b>Good reviews for work satisfaction:</b> 4.1 star rating out of 5</li>
<li><b>Type of work:</b> Designing and maintaining mechanical systems is very<br>interesting to me alongside working out improvements.</li>
<li><b>Salary:</b> it is absolute least 6 figures, meaning that money would<br>not be an issue</li>
</ul>

<p>To be eligible for this job, I need a bachelor’s degree in mechanical<br>engineering, aswell as at least 5 years of experience working as a<br>mechanical engineer in an industrial, process industry, building<br>services, or manufacturing plant environment. I also need to<br>demonstrate commitment to HS&E, safe working practices so that I<br>am not a liability. I would also need to provide evidence that I<br>am able to deliver projects and/or contracts successfully within<br>the allocated timeframe and budget and be eligible to obtain and<br>show responsibility when holding an Australian Government security<br>clearance at the Negative Vetting 1 level.</p>

<p>Currently at this point of time, I have minimal qualifications.<br>As stated, I am still studying to complete my Batchelor of Mechanical<br>Engineering. I have completed a Certificate 2 in Engineering studies<br>at TAFE when I was in high school. As a result of my lack of<br>qualification, I would have to complete my batchelor of mechanical<br>engineering and work as an engineer in a setting listed above for<br>a minimum of 5 years to even be considered. I would then apply for<br>the job and check my eligibility for the security clearance required.</p>

<h2><b>Results of Self-Tests</b></h2>

<h3><b>Myers-Briggs personality test</b></h3>
<p>The Myers-Briggs test determined that my personality was a defender.<br>The defender personality is described as someone who is hard working,<br>loyal and would gladly ‘drop everything and lend a hand whenever<br>a friend or family member is going through a hard time’ without<br>wanting much recognition {reference}.</p>

<h3><b>Online Learning Style test</b></h3>
<p>From the learning style test, it was determined that I am a tactile<br>learner. This means that I am a “hands on” learner that remembers<br>content the best when learnt by attempting tasks ‘through physical<br>movement’ {reference}.</p>

<h3><b>Online Creativity test</b></h3>
<p> {image of creative test} </p>
<p>Referring to the above diagram, it is shown that my creativity score<br>was 57.31, which is 5.52% below average. The results also show<br>that I have above average ‘paradox’, meaning that I have a strong<br>ability to both ‘accept and work with statements that are contradictory’ {reference}.<br>These results also show that I have strong ‘perspective’; ability<br>to shift someone’s perspective on a situation, and ‘curiosity’;<br>ability to think of ideas to solve an outlined problem {Reference}.<br>It can also be seen that I have a lack of creative ‘persistence’;<br>thought for stronger ideas when strong ones have been thought out,<br>alongside a lack of creative ‘boldness’; pushing ‘boundaries beyond<br>accepted conventions’ without ‘fear of what others think of you’ {reference}.</p>

<h3><b>What do the results of these tests mean for me?</b></h3>
<p>The results of these tests determine that I am a hard-working<br>individual, who finds joy to lend a hand to those around me who<br>are struggling. I teach and explain things by showing examples<br>and physically showing how the task is done. I also learn new<br>information by physical movement (e.g. copying notes down multiple<br>times to get concepts stuck in my head). Whilst I do have a very<br>strong ability to understand, accept and work with ideas I would<br>not agree with, I am also good at coming up with initial ideas<br>and expressing my point of view to others.</p>

<h3><b>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</b></h3>
<p>This personality type will ensure that I will always be loyal and<br>responsible when in a team. I would also be the most likely to<br>help other people when they do need it as I feel obliged to.<br>I would also most suit jobs/tasks within the team when forming<br>ideas, designing, and building due to my hands on nature and<br>creative abilities. This may cause some downfalls within my behaviour<br>in a team as my hands on nature makes it hard for me to explain<br>ideas when not in person. I
also would find it very hard to understand<br>what my teammates would be saying as I would need to have it<br>explained in an example. My helpful and outgoing nature might<br>also provide teammates opportunities to ‘use’ me to do the work<br>they don’t want to do. A more minor issue is my physical nature<br>to perform tasks makes it difficult for me to sit down and do writing.</p>

<h3><b>What and how do I need to consider when forming a team?</b></h3>
<p>I would need to be considerate that not everyone is the same as me.<br>This would have to be particularly evident when I would try to convey<br>my ideas to my teammates and assuming that they understand. So,<br>when forming a team, all teammates should express strengths and<br>weaknesses with work tasks. Then, this can help decide which team<br>member is allocated specific tasks required for group work. This<br>should mean that the group should be as cooperative as possible as<br>this should allow for each team member to work in the most suitable<br>task for maximum efficiency of work.</p>

<h2><b>My proposed project idea</b></h2>

<p>As I am very mechanically minded, as well as having an overwhelming<br>interest in cars, I do find vehicle management systems utilising<br>computers quite interesting, particularly engine tuning. Aftermarket<br>Engine Computers and tweaks already exist in abundance for internal<br>combustion powered vehicles. However, there isn’t a straight swap<br>or plug in ‘ECU’ or device that can overcome or tweak features<br>to generally suit EVs. If there was a chip or plug that could<br>utilise a mobile device like a phone to tweak electric cars,<br>this would create more exciting anticipation of the electric<br>car future for car enthusiasts, which now is not overly popular.</p>

<p>Personally, I have a lot of gripes with modern vehicles. The biggest<br>one is all the electronic gismos and gadgets which I find incredibly<br>annoying and distracting. I want feedback to DRIVE the car,<br>not some computer to get it over and done with like a chore.<br>I would love an EV as a daily driver, but I don’t want the blandness<br>that I feel driving them. I propose that the chip or device would<br>plug into the car and then this would allow entry and control<br>of the EVs functions via an user interface on a mobile device<br>(such as a phone) which would communicate what is to be done to the EV.</p>

<p>This application should allow the hardware to chance the following<br>settings in the EV:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Tweak and modify the key workings of the car:</b> This software should<br>be able to turn off features like lane keep assist, centre control<br>screens, radar cruise control, traction control, and stability control.<br>This is so that a rawer feeling can be experienced by the driver<br>during spirited driving. This software needs to also allow key<br>features of the car to be tweaked, like the electric steering feel,<br>amount of power delivered to the motors, and speed limiters.<br>Basically, at the push of a few buttons on a phone, this software<br>should be able to unleash any EV into a complete monster with<br>nothing stopping the driver push the limits of your car.</li>
<li>Modifying key workings of the car should open a whole lot of<br>performance tuning options. For example, the OEM software on an<br>EV may ease the power to the motors when the driver puts the<br>accelerator pedal all the way down. This is to increase reliability<br>and make the cars more comfortable (boring) to operate. This<br>software should allow full power to the motors as soon as the pedal<br>is pressed, increasing the vehicles throttle response. This software<br>may also create opportunities for pumping more power into the motors<br>to increase acceleration and top speed, like upping the boost on a turbocharged car.</li>
</ul>

<p>A benefit of this product would mean that most electric cars, even<br>mundane ones like the Nissan Leaf, would be able to be tuned<br>and modified. This could popularise electric cars within the car<br>enthusiasts’ eye as there would be similar options to enhance<br>performance as with internal combustion engines.</p>

<p>Another benefit of this hardware would be that more tuning shops<br>would specialise in electric cars. There is somewhat of a tuning<br>following specifically for Teslas. For example, there is a company<br>called Unplugged Performance, which is a tuning shop that specialises<br>in Teslas. This company is even endorsed by Tesla themselves like<br>AMG is to Mercedes {reference}. However, taking a specialised car to a<br>shop is incredibly expensive. this option is also not available<br>to anyone outside of the US. As a result of tuning shops incorporating<br>EVs, this may create jobs and knowledge around the EV scene,<br>which would further accelerate the move to all electric vehicles.</p>

<p>There are a few challenges to overcome. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>The main problem of which is making one chip work with many<br>different vehicles. Different EVs would most likely utilise different<br>software to control each vehicle. This may require the selection of<br>a list of vehicles during the setup process, where you pick which<br>vehicle you have.</li>
<li>Manufacturer software locks to prevent safety features being<br>turned off, thus, making the hardware and software completely useless.<br>For example, Tesla did this to stop people bypassing paywalls<br>and accessing hardware without paying {reference}. To overcome this, the<br>skill of finding exploits would be needed so that these security<br>measures can be bypassed.</li>
<li>Liability of users either mechanically ruining their EVs through<br>improper tuning or crashing them as a result of disabling safety<br>features. This could result in serious injury. It would need<br>to be specified that the creators of the software and hardware to<br>provide this service are not at liability to damages and injury;<br>use at your own risk.</li>
<li>How is the mobile device going to connect to the chip? Cable<br>would provide more feedback but has the potential to break and<br>would be difficult to implement on phones. A wireless connection<br>would be much easier to implement as it could use an implemented<br>application. However, this method may be vulnerable to unauthorised<br>users with malicious intent alongside disconnection problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>This product would require code to be written and uploaded onto<br>a manufactured chip, alongside an application to be created to<br>communicate with this code and interact with the vehicle.</p>
