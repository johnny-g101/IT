<h1><b>Assignment 1: My Profile</b></h1>
<h2><b>Introduction and About Me</b></h2>
<p>Hi reader. My name is John Gionis.<br>I am 20 Years of age, my RMIT student number is S3901535 and my<br>RMIT student email address is s3901535@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

<br>

<p>I am Australian in nationality (as I was born in Australia). However,<br>I have a strong Greek heritage on my father’s side which I can<br>engage in quite often. I was originally born in Bendigo but moved<br>to my hometown of Geelong not long before I started primary school.<br>I graduated High School in 2020 and am currently in the second<br>semester of my second year studying my Batchelor of Mechanical Engineering.</p>

<p>I came to RMIT to study because the engineering program is highlhy commended.<br>RMIT teaches by hands on learning, which i find very beneficial.<br>It also happened that my school friends also are attending RMIT,<br>which makes it more comfortable to study as there are people I can talk to.</p>

<p>Alongside the concepts and information I require to be a mechanical engineer,<br>I would expect to mainly develop problem solving skills.<br>This would allow me to attempt IT and Engineering as with both professions,<br>it is expected that you utilise known concepts to scope, design<br>and build something to solve a client's problem statement.</p>

<p>My studies relate to my insane obsession with most wheeled transportation.<br>This mostly incorporates cars, but I also do have an interest in motorbikes, trains,<br>and trams. The latter two have developed more since living in Melbourne.</p>

<p>An interesting fact is that my name is part of a Greek tradition that continues<br>through my name. This tradition is that when a child is born, it is named after the son’s<br>grandfather, and then when that child has a kid, he names it after that kid’s grandfather,<br>and it alternates throughout generations. My grandfather is called John (Yannis).</p>

<h2><b>Interests and Experience in IT</b></h2>

<p>My interest in IT involves utilising modern computers and coding<br>to efficiently operate mechanical systems such as a robot or a train.<br>An example of this is the use of new and advanced aftermarket engine<br>ECUs on 30-50 year old internal combustion engines for more efficiency<br>than before. I also have an interest in Computer Aided Design (CAD)<br>as I use CAD software very often within my course. I enjoy designing,<br>drawing and rendering components that is needed for my course.</p>

<p>Initially, when doing CAD for the first time in 2018, I hated it.<br>However, my interest and enjoyment of utilising CAD started last year<br>during my Creative CAD unit in Semester 1. I found using Solidworks<br>to be incredibly enjoyable to form parts, assemblies and drawings.</p>

<p>My interest in computer and electrical operated mechanical systems<br>started much earlier than that. I could remember when I was much younger,<br>I loved pulling apart computers, CD players and radios to see how<br>they would work by incorporating mechanical and electrical components<br>to form the system. I got older, I would research what each component<br>would do and the microprocessor inputs and outputs and what they would<br>be responsible for within the system of whatever I had pulled apart.</p>

<p>I do not have an avid fascination in networking, gaming or how the<br>internet works. Therefore, meaning I have minimal experience with<br>proper IT work. I have pulled apart and rebuilt computers alongside<br>the compulsory coding I have completed in my other subjects for<br>engineering. For example, I wrote a program in g code to create<br>a baseplate in a C&C machine.</p>

<p>My ideal job is described that CSIRO Business and Infrastructure<br>Services is seeking a Mechanical Systems Engineer for the technical<br>support group based at the Australian Centre for Disease Protection<br>(ACDP). The ACDP helps protect Australia’s multi-billion-dollar<br>livestock and aquaculture industries, alongside protecting the<br>general public from emerging infectious disease threats.</p>

<p>It is described that this role is to provide professional engineering<br>and technical support services to support the B&IS (Business and<br>Industry Services) team to help in safe and successful operation<br>of the ACDP facility. These support services entail leading and<br>communicating responsive, considered, and cost-effective solutions<br>that helps management, maintenance, and operational activities<br>in this facility. The position will ensure the Integrity of ACDP’s<br>High Containment Laboratory.</p>

<p>This position is appealing for the following reasons:</p>
<ul> <style="list-style-type:NONE;"></style>
<li><b>Location:</b> My hometown of Geelong. This means that my support network<br>and family/friends are close to my place of work. It also means<br>that I do not need to readjust to a new town/city as I know where<br>CSIRO is located</li>
<li><b>Uniqueness of the job opportunity provided:</b> Jobs for CSIRO, a<br>government funded laboratory, would be assumed to not appear often<br>so this would be a unique opportunity to take</li>
<li><b>Good reviews for work satisfaction:</b> 4.1 star rating out of 5</li>
<li><b>Type of work:</b> Designing and maintaining mechanical systems is very<br>interesting to me alongside working out improvements.</li>
<li><b>Salary:</b> it is absolute least 6 figures, meaning that money would<br>not be an issue</li>
</ul>

<p>To be eligible for this job, I need a bachelor’s degree in mechanical<br>engineering, aswell as at least 5 years of experience working as a<br>mechanical engineer in an industrial, process industry, building<br>services, or manufacturing plant environment. I also need to<br>demonstrate commitment to HS&E, safe working practices so that I<br>am not a liability. I would also need to provide evidence that I<br>am able to deliver projects and/or contracts successfully within<br>the allocated timeframe and budget and be eligible to obtain and<br>show responsibility when holding an Australian Government security<br>clearance at the Negative Vetting 1 level.</p>

<p>Currently at this point of time, I have minimal qualifications.<br>As stated, I am still studying to complete my Batchelor of Mechanical<br>Engineering. I have completed a Certificate 2 in Engineering studies<br>at TAFE when I was in high school. As a result of my lack of<br>qualification, I would have to complete my batchelor of mechanical<br>engineering and work as an engineer in a setting listed above for<br>a minimum of 5 years to even be considered. I would then apply for<br>the job and check my eligibility for the security clearance required.</p>

<h2><b>Results of Self-Tests</b></h2>

<h3><b>Myers-Briggs personality test</b></h3>
<p>The Myers-Briggs test determined that my personality was a defender.<br>The defender personality is described as someone who is hard working,<br>loyal and would gladly ‘drop everything and lend a hand whenever<br>a friend or family member is going through a hard time’ without<br>wanting much recognition <a href="#1">[1]</a>.</p>

<h3><b>Online Learning Style test</b></h3>
<p>From the learning style test, it was determined that I am a tactile<br>learner. This means that I am a “hands on” learner that remembers<br>content the best when learnt by attempting tasks ‘through physical<br>movement’ <a href="#2">[2]</a>.</p>

<h3><b>Online Creativity test <a href="#3">[3]</a></b></h3>

<br>

<img src="Screenshot 2022-08-08 160340.png" alt="Results of my Creativity test" width="700" height="500">

<br>

<p>Referring to the above diagram, it is shown that my creativity score<br>was 57.31, which is 5.52% below average. The results also show<br>that I have above average ‘paradox’, meaning that I have a strong<br>ability to both ‘accept and work with statements that are contradictory’ {reference}.<br>These results also show that I have strong ‘perspective’; ability<br>to shift someone’s perspective on a situation, and ‘curiosity’;<br>ability to think of ideas to solve an outlined problem {Reference}.<br>It can also be seen that I have a lack of creative ‘persistence’;<br>thought for stronger ideas when strong ones have been thought out,<br>alongside a lack of creative ‘boldness’; pushing ‘boundaries beyond<br>accepted conventions’ without ‘fear of what others think of you’.</p>

<h3><b>What do the results of these tests mean for me?</b></h3>
<p>The results of these tests determine that I am a hard-working<br>individual, who finds joy to lend a hand to those around me who<br>are struggling. I teach and explain things by showing examples<br>and physically showing how the task is done. I also learn new<br>information by physical movement (e.g. copying notes down multiple<br>times to get concepts stuck in my head). Whilst I do have a very<br>strong ability to understand, accept and work with ideas I would<br>not agree with, I am also good at coming up with initial ideas<br>and expressing my point of view to others.</p>

<h3><b>How do I think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</b></h3>
<p>This personality type will ensure that I will always be loyal and<br>responsible when in a team. I would also be the most likely to<br>help other people when they do need it as I feel obliged to.<br>I would also most suit jobs/tasks within the team when forming<br>ideas, designing, and building due to my hands on nature and<br>creative abilities. This may cause some downfalls within my behaviour<br>in a team as my hands on nature makes it hard for me to explain<br>ideas when not in person. I
also would find it very hard to understand<br>what my teammates would be saying as I would need to have it<br>explained in an example. My helpful and outgoing nature might<br>also provide teammates opportunities to ‘use’ me to do the work<br>they don’t want to do. A more minor issue is my physical nature<br>to perform tasks makes it difficult for me to sit down and do writing.</p>

<h3><b>What and how do I need to consider when forming a team?</b></h3>
<p>I would need to be considerate that not everyone is the same as me.<br>This would have to be particularly evident when I would try to convey<br>my ideas to my teammates and assuming that they understand. So,<br>when forming a team, all teammates should express strengths and<br>weaknesses with work tasks. Then, this can help decide which team<br>member is allocated specific tasks required for group work. This<br>should mean that the group should be as cooperative as possible as<br>this should allow for each team member to work in the most suitable<br>task for maximum efficiency of work.</p>

<h2><b>Project Idea:</b></h2>
<h3><b>Overview:</b></h3>
<p>My proposed idea is to implement a chip that would be plugged in to<br>an EV and ‘tune’ them from a user interface on a mobile deice such<br>as a phone. This would mean that, in essence, the user can tweak<br>and customise their EV from their phone. The chip would allow for<br>unwanted features to be deactivated that usually would not be allowed<br>to along with performance enhancements and the way the car drives<br>can be changed at the touch of a button.</p>

<h3><b>Motivation:</b></h3>
<p>Personally, I have a lot of gripes with modern vehicles. The biggest<br>one is all the electronic gismos and gadgets which I find incredibly<br>annoying and distracting. I want feedback to DRIVE the car,<br>not some computer to get it over and done with like a ‘chore’{reference cartrek}.<br>I would love an EV as a daily driver, but I don’t want the blandness<br>that I would feel driving them. For example, one of my biggest<br>criticisms that applies to most modern cars is the lack of steering<br>feedback through the steering wheel because of the steering system<br>that is utilised. This disconnected feel provides a lack of<br>understanding as to what the car is doing through bends. Because<br>the manufacturers of modern cars, EVs included, use this steering<br>system as it is easier to drive, this reinforces a view that<br>manufacturers OEM settings are to get driving ‘over and done with’<a href="#4">[4]</a>.<br>My motivations is to improve the EV by providing a way for the<br>spirited driver to tune their EV the way that they would like it. <br>Thus, this may help the implementation of electric cars in Australia.</p>

<h3><b>Description and Projection of idea:</b></h3>
<p>The disabling of unwanted safety and enhancement features can be<br>done by the user through their smart device. Some of my personal<br>top picks include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lane Keep Assist</li>
<li>Radar Cruise control</li>
<li>Autopilot</li>
<li>Stability Control</li>
<li>Traction control</li>
<li>Blind Spot Monitoring</li>
<li>Speed Warnings</li>
<li>collision warning systems</li>
<ul>

<p>It is thought that the user will select corresponding buttons on<br>their smart device which represents each of these systems. When a<br>button is pressed, this message is communicated to the hardware<br>plugged into the EV. This hardware will modify or disable the code<br>within the EVs onboard Computers to stop these features from operating.</p>
<p>It is also thought that the information screen on the dashboard<br> (like in Tesla’s) could be reduced to absolute fundamental operations<br>that the user wants. This may be able to be chosen in the app by<br>the user. For example, if the user wants only Bluetooth connectivity<br>for music and phone calls, and climate controls, this can be selected<br>in some sort of click box fashion. Then the desired features would<br>be the only thing that can be operated on the screen. There may even<br>be a feature for the user to turn the screen off altogether if they so desire.</p>
<p>To enhance the users’ driving pleasure, the user will be able to<br>activate performance/driver-feedback to enhance the driving<br>experience of their EV. Instead of hydraulic power steering systems<br>of old, modern cars, including EVs, mostly utilises the Electric Power<br>Steering System (EPAS), which utilises a computer, an electric<br>motor and torque sensors to apply assistance power to the steering<br>column via a ball screw mechanism, which allows the motor to apply<br>torque to the steering column whilst also allowing for slipping. <br>This means that the motor will passively assist the steering column<br>in the direction that the torque sensors detect the steering<br>wheel to be spinning instead of directly spinning the column on its own. <a href="#5">[5]</a> <a href="#6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Whilst EPAS systems require ‘less muscle’ to operate, this results<br>in a ‘reduced steering feel’ through the steering wheel as this<br>system has a ‘muted’ ‘mechanical connection’ compared to a hydraulic steering system <a href="#5">[5]</a>.<br> The application should allow the user to control how much EPAS<br>assistance that they want, with the option to turn it off altogether. <br>The application will contain a slider, which will communicate to the<br>hardware connected to the EV the amount of steering assistance that<br>is to be provided by the motor. This should result in an enhanced<br>mechanical feel provided by the steering system when taking a corner.</p>
<p>The user may also be able to enhance and change power output and<br>curves provided by the electric motors. It is known that electric<br>cars provide instant torque. This means that the maximum power of<br>electric motors is gradually eased in when full throttle is applied<br>to preserve mechanical and electrical components. However, the user<br>may be able to select a function under a “performance options” <br>menu, which allows instant full power as soon as full throttle is<br>applied. This would provide enhanced throttle response, allowing<br>for more driving pleasure.</p>
<p>Tuning and turning up power in an electric car could be paralleled<br>with turning up the boost in a turbocharged Internal combustion<br>engine powered car. However, instead of air pressure, it would be<br>more like overclocking a computer; providing more power. The user<br>would have the option to increase the charge taken (amp-hours) from<br>the batteries by the motor controller to provide an increased<br>charge to the motor. This would provide increased enjoyment and fun for the user. </p>

<h3><b>Tools, Technologies and Skills Required:</b></h3>
<p>First, the hardware will need to be designed by a skilled person<br>who knows how to design electronic components so that it can be<br>manufactured and coded to connect to EVs. This manufacturing process<br>after final design is produced requires breadboard manufacturing, <br>chip manufacturing and other electronic component manufacturing. <br>It would then be required that the hardware is soldered together<br>and code uploaded (which is a problem in itself).</p>
<p>Another technology problem to solve would be getting the device to<br>read and modify the data for the many different makes of EVs. <br>This is already a problem with Internal Combustion Engined vehicles<br>as the ECUs and other modules are vehicular, let alone manufacturer<br>specific. A majority of modern EVs utilise more complex computer<br>systems, which may result in more variability between vehicles<br>and manufacturers. It is thought that if one EV could be cracked<br>and controlled, we might require the long and tedious process of <br>getting EVs and writing alternative software to crack and operate<br>that specific EV. If this option works, the mobile device might<br>prompt this hardware to download these different files upon setup.</p>
<p>Another issue surrounding the operation of this product with EVs is<br>potential software locks implemented by the manufacturer to prevent<br>tampering. Manufacturers would be particularly motivated to<br>prevent tweaks due to warranty, safety and maybe even paywall<br>reasons. For example, Tesla did this to stop people bypassing paywalls<br>and accessing certain reserved hardware for paying customers without paying <a href="#7">[7]</a>.<br> This would require people that are good at finding exploits and<br>loopholes in software to get around the EV manufacturers. It could<br>be entirely possible that some makes, and models might not be<br>able to be bypassed.</p>
<p>If this were to be commercially available, the liability of users<br>either mechanically ruining their EVs through improper tuning or<br>crashing them because of disabling safety features may become<br>a problem. Particularly, crashing or battery fires because of<br>overstress, potentially resulting in a serious injury or worse. <br>A lawyer would be required to write a waiver when purchasing<br>the product so that we are not responsible for anything. This<br>is a better option then locking features as I am just as bad as<br>the automakers then. </p>
<p>It also needs to be considered how the mobile device is going to<br>wirelessly connect to the hardware. Bluetooth is too vulnerable<br>for a system this important to someone’s vehicle. It might be<br>required to use a local wi-fi network provided by the hardware<br>which the device connects to, like a wireless printer. This then<br>inconveniences the user because they no longer have internet to<br>listen to music or use maps to direct where they are going</p>

<h3><b>Supposed outcomes:</b></h3>
<p>The main outcome of this product being successful is to improve<br>current EVs for driving purists and revheads. The ability to tune<br>and modify most types of EVs could increase electric cars’ popularity<br>within car enthusiasts as the instant torque, and acceleration that<br>comes along with it would be more enjoyable if the EV were to<br>provide more feedback. </p>
<p>If the popularisation of EVs commences, this may push the government<br>to provide a sustainably powered charging grid, reducing our carbon<br>emission output. This popularity would also open opportunities<br>for many tuning shops to specialise in EVs alongside Internal<br>Combustion engine cars. This would provide jobs where revheads<br>could be employed to do what they are passionate about.</p>
